    "### Summary of Encapsulation Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Public Attributes**:\n",
    "   - Public attributes are not protected and can be accessed from anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Protected Attributes**:\n",
    "   - Protected attributes are supposed to be used within the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Private Attributes**:\n",
    "   - Private attributes can be accessed from public or private methods within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Public Methods**:\n",
    "   - Public methods are directly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Protected Methods**:\n",
    "   - Protected methods should not be directly accessed but should be accessed through public methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Private Methods**:\n",
    "   - Private methods cannot be accessed from subclass objects. They can only be accessed through public or private methods of the class they are defined in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Private Usage**:\n",
    "   - If you want to use an attribute or method only within a specific class, make it private.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Protected Usage**:\n",
    "   - If you want to use it within specific classes (class and subclasses), use protected members.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Public Access**:\n",
    "   - If you later decide to provide access to a previously protected or private member, you can expose it through a public method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying Access Levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reducing Access**:\n",
    "  - To reduce the access level of a member, you can modify or remove the public or protected method that exposes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles will help you maintain proper encapsulation in your Python classes."

    " Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows for flexibility and integration of various objects through a common interface. Here's a breakdown of when and why you should use polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unified Interface**:\n",
    "   - Polymorphism allows you to define a unified interface for different classes. This means you can call the same method on different objects and get behavior that's appropriate for each object.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Code Reusability and Extensibility**:\n",
    "   - By using polymorphism, you can write code that works with objects of different classes without knowing their exact types. This promotes code reusability and makes your codebase more extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplifies Code Maintenance**:\n",
    "   - Polymorphism helps in simplifying code maintenance. Instead of having multiple conditional statements to handle different types of objects, polymorphism allows you to treat them uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Use Cases for Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Implementations of an Interface**:\n",
    "   - When you have multiple classes implementing the same set of methods (interface) in different ways. For example, different types of payments (credit card, PayPal, bank transfer) can all have a `process_payment` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frameworks and Libraries**:\n",
    "   - When designing frameworks and libraries that need to work with a variety of user-defined types. For example, a graphics library might use polymorphism to handle different shapes (circles, squares, triangles) through a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collections of Mixed Objects**:\n",
    "   - When you have a collection of objects of different types that share a common interface. For example, a list of employees where some are full-time and others are part-time, but all can perform a `calculate_salary` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Behavior**:\n",
    "   - When you want to allow different objects to provide specific implementations of a method at runtime, depending on their class. For example, different types of documents (Word, PDF, Text) might have their own `print` method.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### When to Use Polymorphism\n",

    "- **When you need a common interface for different implementations**: This allows you to write code that is more general and works with any new types you might add in the future.\n",
    "- **When you want to simplify code maintenance**: Reduces the need for complex conditional statements and makes your code easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "- **When working with collections of mixed objects**: Enables you to handle different types of objects in a uniform way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a powerful tool in OOP that enhances the flexibility and scalability of your code. By designing systems that leverage polymorphism, you can create robust and adaptable software architectures."

    "[python]: Sure! Here are some notes on composition in object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Composition is a design principle in object-oriented programming where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, forming a \"has-a\" relationship.\n",
    "- **Example**: A `Car` class might have an `Engine` object and `Tire` objects as part of its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**:\n",
    "   - Composition allows you to reuse existing classes as building blocks for new classes, reducing code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - It provides greater flexibility compared to inheritance because you can change the behavior of a class at runtime by changing its components.\n",
    "   - You can create new classes by combining different objects in various ways without modifying the original classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - Composition helps in encapsulating behavior. Each component class can manage its own state and behavior, making the overall system easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Inheritance Pitfalls**:\n",
    "   - Using composition can help avoid some of the issues associated with inheritance, such as the fragile base class problem and tight coupling between base and derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Has-a Relationship**:\n",
    "   - Use composition when there is a \"has-a\" relationship between classes. For example, a `Car` has an `Engine` and `Tires`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Behavioral Changes**:\n",
    "   - Use composition when you want to change the behavior of a class at runtime by changing its components.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reusability**:\n",
    "   - Use composition to create new functionality by combining existing classes without altering their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simplifying Complex Systems**:\n",
    "   - Use composition to break down complex systems into simpler, more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity**:\n",
    "   - Composition promotes modular design by encouraging the creation of small, focused classes that can be combined to form more complex behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintainability**:\n",
    "   - By encapsulating behavior in separate classes, composition makes it easier to maintain and update code. Changes to one component class do not necessarily affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing**:\n",
    "   - Composition allows for more straightforward unit testing. Individual components can be tested in isolation before being integrated into larger systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extensibility**:\n",
    "   - Composition makes it easy to extend systems. You can add new functionality by adding new components or combining existing components in new ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Composition**: A design principle where a class is composed of objects from other classes.\n",
    "- **Why Use It?**: For code reusability, flexibility, encapsulation, and avoiding inheritance pitfalls.\n",
    "- **When to Use It?**: For \"has-a\" relationships, behavioral changes, reusability, and simplifying complex systems.\n",
    "- **Importance**: Promotes modularity, maintainability, testability, and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is a powerful tool in object-oriented programming that helps create flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. By combining objects from different classes, you can build complex systems that are easier to manage and extend."
